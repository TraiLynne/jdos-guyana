Under this contract a change order was issued for the Kalmia Culvert to initiate the fabrication of shop drawings and material purchases in preparation for construction. The culvert on Kalmia Road NW located between East Beach Drive NW and West Beach Drive NW partially collapsed in 2009. DDOT replaced the culvert with a new bridge structure with ADA compliant wheelchair ramps and sidewalks. The culvert was also designed to better accommodate the more than 16,000 daily trips that use the crossing, meet current design standards and adequately sized to handle storm related impacts.</p>

                            <p>In January, 2015, the Ministry of Public Works, Works Services Group (WSG), in conjunction with the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission GGMC), engaged the consulting Team, J-Dos Internationalé, Inc. to provide engineering designs and supervision of works for the Parika to Goshen Road. One of the key challenges to the mining industry is the ability for miners to access the various mining locations; in addition, the opening of this new road would facilitate access to many agricultural lands in the region.</p>
        
                            <p>The proposed Parika to Goshen Road is approximately 56 km (35 miles) long and runs within the right-of-way of the 1962-66 old road alignment (known as the Del Conte Road) on the east bank of the Essequibo River, passing through occupied agricultural and forest lands. It crosses over eighty (80) streams of varying widths from 12 m (40 feet) to 119 m (393 feet). Three (3) major crossings – Naamryck, Bonasika, and Makouria will require extensive civil works before being bridged.</p>

                                <p>The primary goals of rehabilitation of the New York Avenue, NE Bridge project were to enhance pedestrian and vehicular safety and to reduce traffic congestion. Upgrades and repairs to the bridge included upgrading existing bridge superstructure and Amtrak electrical infrastructure, repair of bridge piers and abutments, adding new steel plate girders, replacing existing concrete deck, and improving approach roadways, pedestrian sidewalks, and roadway lighting features.</p>

                                <p>The project involves the demolition and reconstruction of the New York Avenue Bridge and approach roadways between Florida Avenue and 9th Street N.E. and relocation of the catenary support system in the rail yard. Rehabilitation work consists of the demolition, removal, and reconstruction of the bridge superstructure and piers between the existing abutments, widening of the existing abutments, construction of a new sidewalk historic bridge rail, and associated improvements to the approach roadways and adjacent sidewalk areas.</p>

This facility was recommended in the Justice Center Master Plan completed in 1990 and is also a high priority in the Facility Master Plan completed in 2000 and amended in 2003. The project included construction of a new 318,533 square foot, eleven-story building of steel frame construction with natural stone and precast concrete exterior wall and a new 298,600 square foot, 897 parking spaces, five level parking deck of precast concrete construction. The building and parking deck were built concurrently with an earlier completion date for the parking deck. The construction of the parking structure completed in 2011 and the building in 2012.  The new Durham County Courthouse and Parking Structure were built on parcels adjacent to the Durham County Detention Facility.</p>
